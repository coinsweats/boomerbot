BoomerBot collects a bunch of handy info and sends it to a printer so that you can save your tired eyes a little bit of screentime in the morning. 

make sure to chmod +x bb.sh bbp.sh

./bb.sh for a pdf
./bbp.sh to send to a printer; edit this as per your system

This has been running on Mac manually, plan is to set up with cron job on raspberry pi
